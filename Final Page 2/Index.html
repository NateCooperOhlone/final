         <div class="Main-Text"> <p>Hi, my name is Nathan Cooper, and I'm an amatuer 3D animator who loves what he does. I mainly work with Blender, but I have knowledge of Maya and Unity, along with other tools I use for my works like Photoshop, Audacity, and GIMP. I was raised in the California Bay Area, and because of that I feel that many of my inspirations are the results of my environment.</p>
            <p>Thanks to my parents, I grew up as a nerdy kid who loves Sci-Fi and Fantasy adventures, as well as all kinds of anime and cartoons. I play tabletop RPGs with my friends and a lot of my work is based off of the stories and adventures of the characters we play. Right now I'm still studying animation, but my goal is to become a professional animator and someday create a whole series of my own that I can be proud of.</p> </div>
